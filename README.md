# Bravy Chicky Dice Adventure

## Description

This is just a simple turn-based game where you just have to throw a dice, defeat the enemy, and go to the highest floor as you can.

Help Chicky to climb up the Natural Tower by giving it a command. Chicky doesn't quite understand yet what it will do.

There are 4 possible commands to fight the ghost defending the Natural Tower.

By rolling the dice, you can guide Chicky with the possible commands depends on the number appeared on the dice.

- `n == 1` Do nothing
- `n >= 2` Able to Defend
- `n >= 3` Able to Defend, and Attack
- `n >= 5` Able to Defend, Attack, and Heal

Also, you may challenge your friends and brag your highest score.

I haven't been ditching practicing web development these days, and I had hard time creating all these stuff.

This game is best viewed in landscape mode.

## Requirements

1. Text editor (Preferred Visual Studio Code)
1. Terminal (I use the built-in terminal on Visual Studio Code)

## Building the program

For my future reference, below is the way to build the program.

1. Clone the repository
1. Install the dependencies using this command:
   `# npm`
1. Build the main program using this command:
   `# npm run build`
1. At the step above, the distributed program will be produced, and _dist_ folder will be generated. The step from here will be optional if you want to run the program on the localhost.
1. Create a local virtual server using this command:
   `# npm run dev`
1. After building, it can be accessed at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
